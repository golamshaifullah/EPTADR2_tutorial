# A set of tutorials to use with the EPTA DR2 data release

You'll need colab to run these tutorials. You can run them on your local machine, but you'll need to install the required packages.

## Tutorial 1: Introduction to pulsar timing with libstempo

This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of pulsar timing analysis using the libstempo package. We will use the EPTA DR2 data release to perform a simple timing analysis of a pulsar.

## Tutorial 2: Searching for red noise and dispersion measure variations

This tutorial will show you how to search for red noise and dispersion measure variations in pulsar timing data. We will use the EPTA DR2 data release to perform a simple analysis of a pulsar.

## Tutorial 3: Fitting a gravitational wave signal

  In thise tutorial we will fit a gravitational wave signal to the EPTA DR2 data release. We will use the libstempo package to perform a simple analysis of a pulsar.
